# 04 — Design System (GUI)

The local GUI is minimal: a single‑page console for search, ingest, and watch.

- Typography: system stack.
- Theme: respects light/dark; no hardcoded hex (use CSS variables).
- Components: input, results list, event log.
- Accessibility: focus rings, proper labels, keyboard nav.

> This doc is a stub until the GUI lands.
