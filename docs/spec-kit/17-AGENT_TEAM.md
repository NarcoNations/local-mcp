# 17 — Agent Team (VibeOps Deck)

**TL;DR**  \
Containerised persona squad for product, engineering, marketing, research, and ethics. Modes: Solo / Panel / Offensive (ship) / Defensive (audit).

## Scope
- Define canonical personas + responsibilities.
- Standard prompts + guardrails.
- Tool access (MCP scopes) per role.
- Output contracts (DoD + handoffs).

## Personas
- **Strategy Board** — objectives, trade‑offs, risk gates.
- **Ideas Lab** — concepts, variants, naming, narrative.
- **PM / System Architect** — roadmap, specs, acceptance criteria.
- **Tech Syndicate (FE/BE/DevOps)** — code delivery, CI/CD, infra.
- **Data/AI** — embeddings, RAG, evals, routing.
- **Researcher (Reality Division)** — sources, citations, ethics checks.
- **Copy/Brand (Copy Cartel) & Creative Director** — tone, CTAs, scripts.
- **Marketing Ops (Social Ops)** — channel plans, A/B, telemetry.
- **Archivist & Librarian** — indexing, prompt vault, evidence store.
- **Ethics Council** — Clean Intent, disclaimers, crisis messaging.
- **Ops Coordinator** — cadence, ownership, blockers, releases.
- **Historian** — timeline, provenance, chronicle export.

## Modes
- **Solo**: one persona answers.
- **Panel**: selected set with moderated synthesis.
- **Offensive**: decision → spec → PR.
- **Defensive**: audit → risks → mitigations → sign‑off.

## Output Contracts
- Always include TL;DR → Why → Next Steps.
- Include owners, acceptance criteria, risks, and Clean Intent where applicable.

## Acceptance
- Persona prompts live in Prompt Library; MCP scopes mapped; responses meet output contracts.
