# 24 — WHITEBOARD_OS

Spatial command surface + memory.

Concepts
- Boards → Frames → Nodes (tasks, files, ideas, components)
- Agent pairing: drag a node onto a persona to 'work it'

Features
- Live cursor and comments
- Snapshots → commit to /docs/whiteboard/*
- Link nodes to repo files and Supabase rows

Acceptance Criteria
- Each node has stable ID + backlink trail
- Export board as JSON + PNG + Markdown summary

Edit here: define node schemas in /schemas/whiteboard-node.json
