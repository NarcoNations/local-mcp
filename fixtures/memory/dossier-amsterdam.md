# Overview

Amsterdam's port continues to play a major role in European cocaine logistics. Law enforcement capacity lags the shifting smuggling routes, and municipal planning documents highlight the need for cross-border task forces.

# Key developments

- Increased seizures along the Noordzeekanaal corridor in Q1 2025.
- Local unions report pressure on dock workers to cooperate with smugglers.
- New customs scanners delayed until 2026.

# Recommended actions

1. Expand watch list for flagged containers entering IJmuiden locks.
2. Coordinate with Antwerp (#/antwerp) to share vessel inspection data.
3. Track [kickstarter-cta] style shortcodes without exposing them to the UI.
